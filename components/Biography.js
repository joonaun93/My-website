        <p>
          Hello there and welcome to my site! ðŸ˜Š I'm a self taught frontend web
          developer and my tech stack is HTML, CSS, SCSS, JS, React.Js and
          Next.Js
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always been fascinated by code ever since my first encounter
          working with the Arduino microcontroller and its native IDE during my
          undergraduate days.
        </p>

          the Chemical Engineering field- manufacturing, wastewater, consultancy
