This is my personal website work in progress built with next.js as frontend and wordpress CMS for the backend to handle the database.

The blog posts are pulled from wordpress via API calls.

The website is currently lacking any significant styling as it was built as a proof of concept for:

1. Hosting a personal domain + website.
2. Integration of Next.js frontend with headless CMS wordpress backend.
3. Media query for navigation bar and mobile and desktop viewport.

The website can be accessed [here](https://www.edmundkja.dev/)
